# TOCFL Coach (繁)
Traditional-Chinese, TOCFL-aligned web app (A1–B2). Focus: official vocab, Taiwan usage, timed drills, Zhuyin/Pinyin toggle, and a minimal login to sync progress.

## Why this exists
Most apps are Simplified-first or not exam-aligned. We deliver a Traditional-first, TOCFL-format experience with official wordlists and realistic timing.

## Key features (v1 vision)
- Traditional-first UI; toggle to Simplified.
- Pronunciation toggle: Zhuyin / Hanyu Pinyin.
- Band-aligned decks (A1–B2) from SC-TOP/NAER lists.
- Timed Listening/Reading drills that mirror exam formats.
- SRS with Taiwan-usage variants (e.g., 計程車).
- Audio: Taiwan Mandarin preferred; TTS fallback.
- Minimal cloud sync (Supabase) + localStorage offline.

## MVP scope (see `SPEC_MVP.md`)
Vocabulary study + quick test mode on GitHub Pages, syncing optional.

## License
TBD (content licenses vary; see `CONTENT_SOURCING.md`).

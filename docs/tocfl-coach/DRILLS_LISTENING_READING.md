# Exam-like Drills

## Listening (timed, no replay)
- Part A1/A2: everyday dialogs, notices; 1 pass; 5s to answer.
- Part B1/B2: longer prompts; 1 pass; 7–10s to answer.
- Item types: picture-choice; true/false; short MCQ.

## Reading
- A1/A2: signs, ads, short messages; 150–200 chars.
- B1/B2: emails, announcements, short articles; up to 400 chars.
- Item types: gist MCQ; detail MCQ; cloze; match headline→text.

## Scoring model
- Mirror TOCFL points per section; show band cutoffs.
- Store missed words → auto-add to SRS deck.

(Real exam has once-through listening and time pressure; your drills should emulate that constraint.) ([Forumosa][9])

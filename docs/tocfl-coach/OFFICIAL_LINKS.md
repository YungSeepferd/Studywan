# Official Portals & Downloads (SC‑TOP / TOCFL)

Curated official links for maintainers. Validate links periodically; some pages change structure.

## Main Sites
- SC‑TOP (TOCFL official): https://tocfl.edu.tw/
- Taiwan Mandarin Educational Resources Center (LMIT): https://lmit.edu.tw/lc/tocfl

## Exam Downloads (Adult TOCFL)
- Official downloads portal: https://tocfl.edu.tw/tocfl/index.php/exam/download
  - Use for exam outlines, vocabulary lists, and mock tests where provided.

## CCCC (Children’s Chinese) Resources
While our app targets adult TOCFL A–B, CCCC pages provide useful references for listening formats and sample items. Do not mix CCCC items into adult decks; use primarily for inspiration and UI behavior.

- CCCC test page: https://tocfl.edu.tw/tocfl/index.php/test/cccc/list/7
  - “題庫下載” (question bank downloads), including listening/reading sample PDFs.
  - Listening directions (多語言):
    - Example assets: `/tocfl/assets/files/cccc_listening_database/Blossoming_Direction_CG_T.pdf` (German, Traditional), `_S.pdf` (Simplified)
  - International fallback link (when assets blocked abroad): Google Drive folder `1gGxASpZvixQ9OQtaXPQJGGJ7T3lXGKVn`.

Notes:
- Respect licensing terms on all downloads; do not redistribute closed content in-app.
- For adult TOCFL, rely on the “Exam Downloads” page and official vocab lists; keep CCCC references as ancillary format guidance (e.g., once‑through listening, timing cues).

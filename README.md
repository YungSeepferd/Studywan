## Getting Started

Run locally (apps/web):

1) Install deps: `cd apps/web && npm i`
2) Dev server: `npm run dev`
3) Typecheck/tests: `npm run typecheck && npm test`
4) Validate data: `npm run validate:data` (set `STRICT_A1_GLOSSES=1` for A1 gloss enforcement)

Data and content:
- Deck manifest is served from `apps/web/public/data/decks/manifest.json`

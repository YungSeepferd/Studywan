Place Taiwan‑accent TTS or recorded MP3/OGG files in this folder.

Suggestions:
- File names: use card IDs or story IDs (e.g., A1-0001.mp3, story-a2-transport-001.mp3)
- Keep bitrate modest (64–96kbps) for offline caching size
- The PWA runtime caches audio using a CacheFirst strategy (see vite.config.ts)
